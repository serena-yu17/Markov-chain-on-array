This program simulates an array that starts as 10000...

At each time step, choose one of the vertices adjacent to your current
location uniformly at random, and move there.

Let p1(n), p2(n), p3(n), p4(n), p5(n) be the probability your location
after n time steps is v1, v2, v3, v4, or v5 respectively. So p1(0) = 1 and
p2(0) = p3(0) = p4(0) = p5(0) = 0.
